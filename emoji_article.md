# Emoji Ethnicity Update

Last month, [a Twitter campaign](http://act.mtv.com/posts/apple-responds-to-lack-of-diversity-in-emojis/) to diversify the ethnicity of emojis on the iPhone received an answer from Apple's communications department.  It read, in part:

> Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms.  There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.

Apple's response to [#emojiethnicityupdate](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23emojiethnicityupdate&src=hash) is interesting because it comes at a moment of soaring emoji popularity.  Now that these little icons have been encoded for use on Android and Apple mobile platforms alike, they increasingly serve as [stand-ins for words themselves](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/these-emojis-would-like-to-help-you-structure-your-data/360365/).  The question of who is represented and who is excluded in this increasingly international and platform-agnostic alphabet is a tricky one.

Emojis, their reception and circulation point to a specific emergence that brings together mobile platforms, their network connectivity with the Internet as well as the future of personal computing.  The narrative of mobile phone development has been that, increasingly, our phones can do what Internet connected personal computers with the rise of 3G, LTE, and next generation processors.  But this development moves the other way as well, with our personal computing tools increasingly mimicking the techniques and practices of our mobile phones.  For example, I can now download [Chromoji](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromoji-emoji-for-google/cahedbegdkagmcjfolhdlechbkeaieki?hl=en-GB), a browser plugin that displays emojis in my browser. With [Mac OS X Lion](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5098), the emoji character set is available in any text input. While emoticons have been available in word processing programs like Microsoft Word since 2003, the circulation of emojis on mobile platforms allows us to think differently about what is happening when use communicate with mobile platforms. [NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS SAYING?  Have to spike this somehow -- what's the cite on "fingered speech"?  Would be nice to speculate that gestural communication born on mobile phones (just texting an arm emoji, or a face, a gesture that suffices better than a sentence) is coming back to influence bigger, personal computers and more.]

# "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."

But updating emojis and ensuring their compatibility across platforms is not so simple.  Apple's explanation points to the Unicode Consortium, the nonprofit foundation responsible for establishing standards for the interoperability of the world's languages.  Unicode released their encoding for emojis in April 2010, which would allow mobile phone platforms around the world to share emojis.  Rather than selecting *which* characters belonged in this alphabet, Unicode based their standard on a core set of 722 emojis in use by the top three mobile phone networks in Japan: DoCoMo, DKKI, and Softbank.  The main heft of Unicode's work was to translate each of those carrier-specific encodings (which were stored in ISO-2022-JP) to a single standard that could then play nicely with any international character set.  [Here](http://www.au.kddi.com/ezfactory/tec/spec/img/typeD.pdf), for example, is a chart showing all of KDDI's original emoji encodings.

Current Unicode standard specifications do include two faces with deliberate ethnic markers (1F472 üë≤ Man With Gua Pi Mao and 1F473 üë≥ Man With Turban), while all of the other human faces can be interpreted or rendered in radically different ways.  Every character included in Unicode is given a four-digit hexadecimal number called a "code point."  It then takes a font to actually render these code points as a specific "glyph," which is the graphical skin built upon that hexadecimal foundation.  Thus when your computer reads 1F366 it displays üç¶.  But the ice cream cone on my Android phone will look nothing like the ice cream cone on your iPhone.  And so the appearance of a human face can vary depending on the font and the GUI of the messaging client that it is rendered in.  Unicode, as their [FAQ](http://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html) reads, "does not require a particular racial or ethnic appearance ‚Äî- or for that matter, a particular hair style: bald or hirsute."

The picture becomes muddled even further when we read Unicode's professed desire to encode emojis "primarily on their general appearance, not on an intended semantic."^[Placing the #EmojiEthnicityUpdate controversy at the doorstep of Unicode is ironic because Unicode is the primary engine by which people can translate a character from virtually any language in the world into a file format designed for virtually any other language in the world.  It is a swiss army knife of international natural language processing.]  That is, the Unicode consortium tries as much as possible to curate its list of symbols without any preconceived notions of their meaning and how they are used in messaging platforms.  

# Syntax without Semantics
Joel Spolsky, in [an article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) on Unicode famous among programmers, refers to the characters encoded in Unicode as "platonic ideals ‚Ä¶ floating in heaven."  While A is different than a, A in Courier is semantically equivalent to A in Helvetica.  But if we accept this agnosticism toward the meaning of emojis, encoded emoji characters are then a syntax without semantics.  Like Noam Chomsky's famous sentence showing a syntax without semantics -- "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" --  they are pictographs that can take on entirely new meanings depending on their local applications.  "In fact," the Unicode documentation continues, "when used as emoji, many of these characters acquire multiple meanings based on their appearance; for example, an emoji character for ‚Äúbank‚Äù which includes the letters ‚ÄúBK‚Äù has taken on the secondary meaning ‚Äúbakkureru‚Äù (a slang term for evading one‚Äôs responsibilities)."

It is for this reason that we can't say precisely how many emoji have been encoded in Unicode and appear differently across platforms after the original 722-character set imported from Japanese mobile characters.  Preexisting pictographs in the Unicode standard, such as 214F ‚Öè "Symbol for Samaritan Source" (a character *itself* used in ancient Hebrew to translate between alphabets), could possibly be used in ways far different from its original function.^[The original Unicode proposal for this character can be found at <http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3217.pdf>.]  Perhaps it's this kind of semantic drift that can turn any given character into an emoji, which we might understand as a form of flexibility. For example, [in defense of her most used emojis] (http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/defend-your-list-jenna-wortham-on-her-most-recently-used-emo) New York Times tech writer, Jenna Worthham, explained that she uses arm and "100" as, "an affirmative signal" that means the same thing as yes.

Ultimately, the story of emojis is about how communication practices develop in relation to standards.  When Spolsky describes Unicode as a specific "way of thinking about characters," it doesn't just mean characters on their own, but what emojis mean for people communicating with one another on mobile phones. The way that these characters "think" are becoming something completely different.  Increasingly, our mobile phones are becoming reading and writing machines, they are changing the ways we communicate with characters and text. If we accept that there is a Unicode way of thinking about characters, what is the user-specific way of thinking about communication?  When emojis are beginning to look less like a language and more like a series of objects, we have to have a closer attention to *what* and *how* things mean.

Reading through the grey literature of the Unicode Consortium, for instance, we can see how difficult it has been to distinguish between a character as a semantic unit and a "graphic object" unique to the transmission of those characters.  Bindu characters in the Batak script from the Indonesian island of Sumatra, for instance, are "used to disambiguate similar words or phrases."  Is the snake-like bindu pinarjolma ("human-being shaped bindu") and its many different glyph variants an anthropomorphic character with a specific textual purpose, or is it a "graphic page element that does not behave at all as characters," in the words U.S. National Body of Unicode's argument in February 2010 (INCITS/L2/10‚Äê066)?

Here, the distinction between a graphic object and a character becomes ambiguous, sitting somewhere in between what Jerome McGann calls the pagespace and the textspace [@mcgann_radiant_2004, 149].  What kinds of objects do we text from one personal device to the next in a form of "textured" or "fingered speech" that has no oral component, a morphology without an accompanying phonology?

# Convergence: Platforms, the Internet, Mobile computing

So we've established my ice cream cone and your ice cream cone may look different across platforms, but because of versioning and mobile operating system updates, a palm tree that you send to me may not even appear, it could be a blank character or "X"ed out. In software design this is characterized as "backwards compatibility" one of the chief principles of interoperability across information systems.

![Blank text messages in messaging clients from two mobile operating systems, iOS5 and Android 4.04.](images/blank_texts.png)

Blank texts have increasingly begun to appear and confuse recipients in other ways because of emojis. Quite recently, Apple‚Äôs popular iPhone mobile operating system (iOS) updated to its seventh version. This version update employs a new codec of emojis, popular (sometimes animated) emoticons of cartoon faces and icons like a heart or a shovel. The iOS7 codec is proprietary and builds off of the ISO/IEC 10646 Unicode standard but it is not backwards compatible (including most other library messaging codecs) on other mobile operating systems. The result of this iOS7 platform update involves, among other incompatibility issues, a slew of blank texts when iOS users send emojis in texts to recipients whose mobile operating systems are not versions of iOS. Symbian and Android users report receiving blank texts, in addition to other kinds of corrupted iMessages (the proprietary messaging format that iOS defaults to unless otherwise changed). More simply, these kinds of blank text messages are a result of receiving emoji texts from a closed platform mobile operating system like iOS. Amongst many possible meanings, blank texts from iOS users communicate the incompatibility issues across mobile platforms.

Blank texts, and what they may mean over time, resist what Mark Poster [-@poster_information_2004] has called the grammatical structure of the information system found in our text messaging clients, because they carry multiple possibilities of interpretation, intention and agency as traces of mobile communication. Still further, they rely upon individual users, writers and readers, to interpret their contexts at points of creation, boundary crossings (transmission), and reception. Their interpretation and significance through time, as evidence of transactions between people, may change are subject to multiple infrastructures. 

The contexts of sending, receiving, text messages with emojis provides a promissory encounter to the power that text messages have as a new genre of writing with mobile media. It also shows the power of metadata that is generated, collected, and imbued with meaning when we communicate with text messages and how metadata, separate from content, can be interpreted and used in different ways. The manifold reasons for blank text messages (and their reception) illustrates the knot of infrastructure, communication practices, meaningful records, and digital collections that continue to unfold and form. ‚ò∫
